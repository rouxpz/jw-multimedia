        <p><strong>Wednesdays, 6:00pm - 8:45pm</strong>
<strong>Prof. Roopa Vasudevan</strong>
<strong><a href="mailto:rvasudevan@fordham.edu">rvasudevan@fordham.edu</a></strong>
<strong>Office hours by appointmen</strong>t</p>

<p>This class is designed to introduce students to the basics of multimedia journalism, with an emphasis on video production but also extending to interactive and web journalism.  The first half of the class will focus on technical skills and the software needed to produce video content for the web, while also reviewing the basics of visual and aural storytelling.  The second half will cover motion graphics, data visualization and the basics of interactive journalism and storytelling.  There will also be individual workshopping days throughout the semester for more tailored instruction and assistance related to specific projects.</p>

<p>There will be three (3) projects produced as part of this class.  The first two will be in teams of two people, and the last can either be in a group or individual.  All projects will be produced specifically for publication in THE OBSERVER.  Projects will be published based on quality of production and appropriateness of content for the Fordham audience.  Participation in this class does NOT guarantee publication in THE OBSERVER, although all work in the class is created with this goal in mind.</p>

<p>By the end of this course, students should feel comfortable with outlining, shooting, editing, and posting video content to the web, as well as gain familiarity with other forms of multimedia storytelling.</p>

<h2>
<a id="class-expectations" class="anchor" href="#class-expectations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CLASS EXPECTATIONS</h2>

<p>Participation is very important and will impact grading.  In particular, critique will play a large and crucial role in this class.  Please pay attention when fellow students are presenting their work and be prepared to give thoughtful, considerate feedback.  Keep all feedback related to the work only; personal attacks will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Laptops and cell phones are not to be used in class, as there are designated computers in the classroom on which to work.  Computers are to be used for following along during demos and for individual project work during workshopping days.  Please do not use the computers during class discussions or during other students’ project critiques.</p>

<p>Projects are due by the beginning of class on the assigned due date.  Grades will drop 10% for every day past the due date that an assignment is not turned in.</p>

<p>Attendance is mandatory.  More than two (2) unexcused absences will result in automatic failure.  Please be prompt to class; lateness of more than ten (10) minutes will count as an unexcused absence unless cleared beforehand.</p>

<p>As in written and academic work, it is extremely important that you credit sources used that are not your own, and any collaborators you may work with.  Any plagiarism or uncredited outside contributions found in any work will result in a failing grade on the project.  </p>

<p>I welcome feedback and am eager to hear your thoughts about the class.  If something isn’t working for you or you’re feeling behind, do not hesitate to let me know.  The sooner I find out about any issues, the sooner I can fix them!</p>

<a id="required-materials" class="anchor" href="#required-materials" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>REQUIRED MATERIALS</h2>

<p>It is highly recommended that students purchase an external hard drive for this class on which to store media and projects, as it is never guaranteed that you will be on the same computer from week to week.  A USB flash drive will suffice (minimum 16GB, but 32GB or 64GB is preferable), or you can purchase a larger drive.  Drives are available at the Fordham bookstore, most major electronics stores, or online through vendors such as Amazon.</p>

<p>Students will be required to post weekly updates and progress on a blog of your choosing: either an existing blog with a specific, class-related tag, or a new blog created especially for the class.  Some good resources for blog creation are Wordpress, Tumblr, or Blogger, but any platform may be used as long as it is publicly accessible.</p>

<p>A University, by its nature, strives to foster and recognize originality of thought. Originality can only be recognized, however, when people acknowledge the sources of ideas or works that are not their own. Therefore, students must maintain the highest standards with regards to honesty, effort and performance. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating on exams, false authorship, and destruction of library materials needed for a course. This policy gives definitions and instances of violations of academic integrity, the procedures used to arrive at a judgment, possible sanctions, and the process of appeal. This policy will be enforced rigorously and without discrimination. Please refer to your Student Handbook for a full discussion of the Policy on Academic Integrity.</p>
